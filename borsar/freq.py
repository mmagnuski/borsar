    Compute power spectral density (psd) for given time segments for all
    channels of given raw file. The segments (if more than one) are averaged
    taking into account the artifact-free range of each segment. Signal during
    _BAD annotations (parts of signal marked as artifacts) is excluded by
    default in `mne.time_frequency.psd_welch` which can lead to some segments
    'donating' more data than others. This has to be taken into account during
    segments averaging - so the segments are weighted with the percentage of
    welch windows that had artifact free data (and thus were not rejected in
    `mne.time_frequency.psd_welch`).

    raw: mne.Raw
        Raw file to use.
    events: numpy array N x 3 or None
        Mne events array. If None (default) `tmin` and `tmax` are not
        calculated with respect to events but the whole time range of the
        `raw`.
    event_id: list or numpy array
        Event types to use in defining segments for which psd is computed.
        If None (default) and events were passed all event types are used.
    tmin: float
        Lower edge of each segment in seconds. If events are given the lower
        edge is with respect to each event. If events are not given only one
        segment is used and `tmin` denotes the lower edge of the whole `raw`
        file.
    tmax: float
        Higher edge of each segment in seconds. If events are given the higher
        edge is with respect to each event. If events are not given only one
        segment is used and `tmax` denotes the higher edge of the whole `raw`
        file.
    winlen: float
        Length of the welch window in seconds.
    step: float
        Step of the welch window in seconds.

    '''
    Format power spectral densities. This includes channel selection, log
    transform, frequency range selection, averaging frequencies and calculating
    asymmetry (difference between left-right homologous sites).

    Parameters
    ----------
    psds : numpy array
        psds should be in (subjects, channels or vertices, frequencies) or
        (channels or vertices, frequencies) shape.
    freq : numpy array of shape (n_freqs,)
        Frequency bins.
    info : mne.Info
        Info about the recordings. Used for channel selection.
    freq_range : tuple or listlike with two elements
        Lower and higher frequency limits.
    average_freq : bool
        Whether to average frequencies.
    selection : str
        Type of channel selection. See `borsar.channels.select_channels`.
    transform : str or None
        Type of transformation applied to the data. 'log': log-transform;
        None: no transformation.
    div_by_sum : bool
        Used only when selection implies asymmetry ('asy' is in `selection`).
        If True the asymmetry difference is divided by the sum of
        the homologous channels: (ch_right - ch_left) / (ch_right + ch_left).
        Defaults to False.
    src : mne.SourceSpaces
        SourceSpaces for given subjects or the same for all subjects if data
        contains multiple subjects.
    subjects_dir : str
        FreeSurfer subjects directiory.
    subject : str
        Selected subject in subjects_dir to use.

    Returns
    -------

        Transformed psds.
    freq : numpy array
        Frequency bins.

        Channel names.
